Like many others in tech, I got curious about how these agents work together to handle complex tasks. The idea of systems that can reason, delegate, and collaborate like human analysts felt powerful, but also a bit abstract. Reading articles helped, but the real clarity came through building. So, with a few teammates and a lot of curiosity, we took the idea to a hackathon. We decided to create a working proof of concept: an agentic AI system designed to handle the kinds of challenges we encounter every day in a global organization , like going through large log files, tracing performance issues, and raising incident tickets when required, with summarized error details.This article is for AI builders curious about how modular, agent-based systems can automate operational workflows. It walks through a practical design where LLM-powered AI agents collaborate to analyze logs, inspect code, query databases, and auto-raise incidents — all from a natural language query.# Why Modular Intelligence is Required

Here’s the drill when an error pops in production, latency spikes, or something breaks — we start looking into logs, databases, and paging through a lot of documentation pages to understand what went wrong. These incidents are usually messy. Sometimes the issue is mentioned in the log files, other times it is buried in code or hidden in a ticket someone resolved 8 months ago. And occasionally, it’s clear that the problem just needs to be escalated immediately.These kinds of problems aren’t easy to automate with traditional tools. Most automation works well only when things are predictable and repeatable.This is where **modular **AI systems can help, where instead of trying to solve everything with a single tool or process, we can use a set of specialized agents. Each can be focused on one task, like analyzing logs, scanning code, or documentation for known patterns, or querying a database. These agents can talk to each other to reason and operate intelligently as a group. This modular approach has another benefit too: it is easy to swap out or test individual components independently. Modular intelligence isn’t just a nice-to-have, but it’s quickly becoming essential to keep up with the complexity and speed of operations today.# What are Agentic AI systems?

Agentic AI systems are made up of multiple intelligent agents that can sense what’s happening, reason about it, plan, and act autonomously [1]. In practice, these systems often leverage large language models (LLMs) to understand context, make decisions, use tools, and communicate with each other by passing along context to complete tasks collaboratively. Instead of one monolithic chatbot handling everything, we get a team of specialized AI workers that can coordinate their efforts.# A Walkthrough: How an Agentic AI System Handles an Operational Issue

To understand this better, let’s say a user asks this query: **“Why is task ID TID65738 failing?”** Here is how a modular agent system could handle this query end-to-end:The system starts with an **Orchestrator Agent**. This agent reads the request and figures out which specialized agents need to be involved.1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Interprets the user’s request and decides which agents to invoke.
*Example prompt: “Decide which agents to invoke from LogAgent, DatabaseAgent, CodeAgent, etc.”*From there, each agent works on its part of the problem:2. **Log Agent**: Reads the log files for clues related to the task ID failure. It. tries to find if the failure is due to a fixable error (like an exception) or a performance issue (like latency).*Example prompt:* *“Check content in the log files and classify if the issue is a fixable exception or a latency issue.”***3. Code Agent**: If the Log Agent finds a specific error, the Code Agent retrieves the relevant code (e.g., from a GitLab repository), correlates the error to the code, and suggests a likely root cause or fix. It can suggest changes or point to specific parts of the codebase that need attention.*Example prompt:* “Using the GitLab code snippet and error, suggest a likely root cause and a fix.”**4. Database Agent**: If the issue appears to be performance-related, the Database Agent fetches metrics and timestamps from monitoring databases to check for bottlenecks or delays related to the task.*Example prompt: “Return timestamps and detect any performance bottlenecks for the given task ID.”***5. Incident Agent**: This agent can be triggered to check historical incident records and see if a similar issue has occurred before. It provides contextual insights like how many times this error happened in the past six months, or links to past incident reports.*Example prompt: “Search for past incidents similar to this error and summarize findings.”***6. JIRA Agent**: If the issue needs escalation (for example, it’s a new bug or a recurring problem that needs tracking), this agent will create a new ticket. It takes the analysis from the other agents (error details, suggested fix, context) and drafts a JIRA ticket with a summary.*Example prompt: “Using context from other agents, create a JIRA ticket with a summary and link.”*This team-of-agents approach means the system can dynamically route tasks to the right expert agent, much like a human team would collaborate to solve a problem.AI Agents used in the System are powered by LLMs [Source: author]# Example Scenarios of Agent Workflows

Here are a few sample queries and the agents that would be involved in each case:1. **Query:** “Why is task ID TID65738 failing? Check if this issue was caused by a recent code change.”
**Agents involved:** Orchestrator -> Log -> Code*(The system checks the logs for errors and then looks at recent code changes via the Code Agent.)***2. Query:** “Give me the processing time and latency of task ID TID65738.”**Agents involved:** Orchestrator -> Log -> Database*(The Log Agent finds where the task ran in logs, then the Database Agent retrieves metrics from the database stored on any azure service)***3. Query**: “Create a JIRA ticket with the task ID TID65738 failure details.”**Agents involved:** Orchestrator -> Log -> Code -> JIRA*(The system gathers error details from the Log and Code agents, then the JIRA Agent creates a JIRA ticket.)***4. Query: **“Which step in the workflow took the longest for task ID TID65738?”**Agents involved:** Orchestrator -> Database -> Code*(The Database Agent identifies slow steps, and the Code Agent correlates those steps to code files.)***5. Query**: “How many similar incidents happened this month?”**Agents involved: **Orchestrator -> Incident*(The Incident Agent searches the incident database for similar issues in the past month.)***6. Query: **“Generate a report and escalate this task issue.”**Agents involved: **Orchestrator -> Log -> Database -> Incident ->JIRA*(A comprehensive request where the system analyzes logs, gathers metrics, checks past incidents, and then creates a JIRA report.)***7. Query:** “List the top 10 slowest tasks in the past day.”## Get Anubha Bhaik’s stories in your inbox

Query:** “Summarize the cause of a task failure and any past similar incidents.” **Agents involved:** Orchestrator -> Log -> Incident*(The Log Agent finds the error cause of the task failure, and the Incident Agent adds historical context about similar failures.)*These scenarios show how the orchestrator can flexibly assemble a pipeline of agents based on the query. The user simply asks a question in natural language, and the system figures out which pieces need to work together to deliver an answer or solution.# Popular Frameworks for Supporting Multi-agent Systems:

Today, there are many frameworks that support LLM-based multi-agent systems. Some popular open-source frameworks are:- **LangGraph**: It is a graph-based framework that is developed by LangChain Inc. It helps in adopting workflow orchestration with real-time visibility into agent reasoning and actions. [2]
- **CrewAI**: It is a Python framework that supports autonomous operations through clear roles for agents. [3]
- **Semantic Kernel: **It supports modular, plugin-style agents that can be added to existing code, and helps in quickly producing a scalable, production-ready multi-agent orchestration. [4]
In this article, we will go through the design of a multi-agent system using Semantic Kernel and Azure.# Technical Design with Semantic Kernel and Azure Tools

For this project, we used **Semantic Kernel**, which is a lightweight, open-source SDK that makes it easy to integrate AI services and build complex workflows with plugins (which we use to implement our agents). It provides built-in support for orchestrating LLM prompts across multiple agents and can integrate smoothly with Azure services (Functions, Azure OpenAI, Blob storage, Cosmos DB, etc.). For instance, we used the AzureChatCompletion service to connect Azure OpenAI (GPT-4) to our agent prompts.Here’s a simple example.Let’s say we’ve built a **Log Agent** and a **Code Agent** as plugins in Semantic Kernel, with each agent having its prompt logic. One of the challenges in these systems is enabling these agents to **talk **to each other. For example, passing the error summary extracted by the Log Agent into the Code Agent’s prompt for root cause analysis. Semantic Kernel’s orchestration capabilities let us do this chaining in a clean, asynchronous way. This allows each agent to focus on its task while still sharing information smoothly between steps.## Agent Chaining with Semantic Kernel

In the Semantic Kernel, we set up an orchestrator function (let’s call it ClassifyAgents ) that reads the user query and decides which agents need to be invoked.Here’s a simplified example in Python showing how this works.First, we initialize the kernel, register our AI model, and load the agents as plugins:# Initialize the Semantic Kernelkernel = Kernel()# Add Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o) as the LLM servicekernel.add_chat_service(    "gpt-4o",    AzureChatCompletion(        deployment_name="gpt-4o",        endpoint="https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com/",        api_key="your-azure-api-key"    ))# Import agents (plugins)log_agent = kernel.import_semantic_skill_from_directory("./LogAgent", "LogAgent")code_agent = kernel.import_semantic_skill_from_directory("./CodeAgent", "CodeAgent")orchestrator_agent = kernel.import_semantic_skill_from_directory("./OrchestratorAgent", "OrchestratorAgent")Let’s say the orchestrator prompt is designed to return a comma-separated list of agent names based on the query. For example, if the user asks, **“Why is task TID-12345 failing?***”*, the orchestrator might respond with something like “log_agent, code_agent”.Here’s how we run it in code:# Create a context with the user query context = kernel.create_new_context() context["input"] = "Why is task TID-12345 failing?"# Use the orchestrator to decide which agents to call orchestrator_result = await kernel.run_async(orchestrator_agent["ClassifyAgents"], input_vars=context)# Parse the result into a Python list agents_to_call = [agent.strip() for agent in orchestrator_result.result.split(",")]Once we have the list of agents to run, we can call them one by one. As each agent runs, it can pass its results into the shared context for others to use.# If the Log Agent is needed, call it firstif "log_agent" in agents_to_call:    # Fetch relevant logs for the task ID)    context["log_data"] = fetch_logs("TID-12345")    context["task_id"] = "TID-12345"    # Run the LogAgent plugin (which has a function to classify the log error)    log_result = await kernel.run_async(log_agent["ClassifyLogError"],    input_vars=context)    # Save the error summary from logs into context for other agents to use    context["error_summary"] = log_result.result# If the router suggested a Code Agent and the issue appears fixableif "code_agent" in agents_to_call and "error_summary" in context:    # Retrieve a relevant code snippet from the repository (e.g., based on error or stack trace)    context["code_snippet"] = fetch_gitlab_code("TaskProcessor.java",    context["error_summary"])    # Run the CodeAgent plugin to analyze the code and suggest a fix    code_result = await kernel.run_async(code_agent["SuggestFix"],    input_vars=context)    suggested_fix = code_result.resultWe can follow the same pattern to run other agents too, such as the **Database Agent** or **Incident Agent** if they were listed in *agents_to_call*. Each time an agent runs, it updates the context with new data (like metrics or incident history) for subsequent agents to use. By using an orchestrator and context sharing, each agent’s output can feed into the next agent’s input.This kind of step-by-step chaining is orchestrated by the LLM itself (via the orchestrator agent’s capability to use the LLM to decide which agent to call). The orchestrator agent Semantic Kernel handles the outcome to call those tools (our custom plugins) with the correct data.A use case of how a query processed through agents to produce a response on the UI [Source: Author]## How the Code Agent Navigates Large Codebases

Strategies below can be adopted to overcome the challenge of designing the Code Agent to effectively search a large codebase for relevant snippets:1. **Static Filtering:** The first step is to narrow down the search space by filtering files. For example, if the error looks like a Java exception, we focus only on .java files. If the error mentions a specific module, we restrict the search to that module’s directory.
2. **Use Error Context:** We also use clues from the error itself, like the stack trace, error message, function names, or line numbers, to identify the most likely parts of the codebase. For example, if the logs show an exception in TaskProcessor, the agent knows to look at files related to that class.
3. **Semantic Search:** To go beyond basic keyword matching, we use embeddings to perform a semantic search. Both the error description and the code files are embedded into a vector database (e.g., using Azure Cognitive Search or a similar vector database [5]). The Code Agent can then run a similarity search to retrieve the top-K most relevant code snippets or files that might relate to the error.
4. **Targeted Code Analysis:** The agent only pulls a handful of likely relevant code snippets (instead of entire files) and feeds those, along with the error context, into the LLM. This keeps the prompt efficient and focused. The LLM then analyzes the snippets, identifies the root cause, and may even suggest code changes.
By combining static filtering, error context with semantic search, the Code Agent can focus on the relevant parts of a huge codebase and avoid overwhelming the LLM with irrelevant code.## Operationalizing the System via UI and Power Automate

To make this multi-agent system usable in the real world, a simple interface is essential. The modular design makes it easy to plug the system into different front-ends and to test components in isolation. In our case, we integrated the agent workflow with a chat interface in Microsoft Teams using Power Automate [6].Here’s how it works:We set up a Power Automate flow in Teams that listens for specific commands or keywords. The flow then takes the user’s natural language query and sends it to our backend, where the Semantic Kernel orchestrator is running (hosted as an API on Azure). Since many operations teams and developers already use Teams for daily collaboration, this allowed them to query the AI system in a tool they use daily, without switching context.Once the query reaches our backend, the orchestrator takes over. It runs the necessary agents as described earlier (log analysis, code lookup, etc.), chains their results together, and generates a response. This response might include error diagnostics, suggested fixes, performance metrics, or even a link to a newly created JIRA ticket. Power Automate then posts this response back to the Teams channel, sometimes tagging the relevant user or team.By integrating LLM-driven agents with tools like Semantic Kernel and Power Automate, we were able to build a prototype that doesn’t just **respond** to queries but actively **reasons** through multi-step problems and takes actions (like logging an incident). The use of natural language interfaces means minimal training for users, where they can just ask a question as they normally would.# Conclusion

This modular design of an agentic system is just one example of how collaborative intelligence can be applied in high-pressure environments. It can reduce triage time from hours to seconds by directly pinpointing root causes from log files and code, and even auto-generating JIRA tickets complete with summaries and links. Instead of spending time going through the log files or documentation, users can focus on reviewing solutions and resolving the problem.By combining LLMs with enterprise tools like Semantic Kernel (for orchestration) and Power Automate (for user interaction), we built a system that acts more like a helpful teammate than a traditional automation script. As technical systems continue to grow in complexity, these kinds of modular, AI-powered tools could play a big role in improving how teams manage operations and solve problems at scale.## References:
