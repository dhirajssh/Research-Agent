[Andy Ï„Ï„](/bittingthembits)[@bittingthembits](/bittingthembits)FollowClick to Follow bittingthembitsAI Agents are EXPLODING in enterprise [$TAO](/search?q=%24TAO&src=cashtag_click)  "Small, agile 'squads' of 3-4 engineers are most effective"  ( Bittensors Agentic Subnets  )

The stats are insane:
 68% of enterprise companies adopted agentic AI
 33% deploying AI agents (3x increase in 2 quarters)
 30% QoQ growth in monitoring AI apps

Here's what enterprises discovered:

"Everyone is a builder, everyone is a manager of AI agents"

"The days of betting on a single LLM provider are over"

The winning formula:
 Multi-model strategies
 Small nimble teams  
 Practical applications over AGI hype
 Rapid testing and iteration

Wait... this sounds familiar 

Bittensor Subnets = Enterprise AI Best Practices:

 Small Teams: Each subnet = 3-4 core contributors
 Specialized Roles: Miners + Validators = defined functions  
 Multi-Model: 120+ subnets = different AI approaches
 Practical Focus: Real solutions, not AGI promises
 Rapid Innovation: Decentralized = faster iteration

Examples:
â€¢ SN4 Targon =  accuracy of responses from language models 
â€¢ SN5 Templar = Distributed LLM training teams
â€¢ SN12 ComputeHorde = Decentralized compute squads  
â€¢ SN63 Quantum = Specialized quantum teams
â€¢ SN64 Chutes = Deploy, run and scale any AI model in seconds
â€¢ SN 68 Nova = decentralized drug discovery, specifically virtual drug screening
â€¢ SN124 Swarm = Drone navigation specialists

Enterprises are DISCOVERING what Bittensor built from day one

"Companies are deploying agents to help customers automate workflows"

That's literally what every Bittensor subnet does!

While enterprises pay millions for:
 Large AI teams
 Vendor lock-in
 Centralized infrastructure

Bittensor delivers:
 Incentivized small teams
 Multi-model freedom  
 Decentralized coordination
 Pay-for-performance

AI agent Subnets:

SN 1 Apex Macrocosmos improves LLM inference by incentivizing agentic workflows and generating fine-tuning data at scale.
SN62 Ridges AI marketplace for autonomous software agents, incentivizing AI-driven solutions to complex coding challenges.
SN36 Autoppia web automation agents to perform tasks across dynamic websites.
SN 45 SWE-Rizzo code generation, bug fixing, and software
SN 49 Polaris agents to Solana for automating complex Web3 and DeFi tasks.
SN 59 Agent Arena MASA competitive ecosystem where agents evolve through real engagement, market forces, and value.
SN 94 Eastworld autonomous AI agents in a virtual world using decentralized crypto incentives.
SN 121 Sundae Bar connecting AI agent developers with users for scalable deployment.

The future of AI isn't mega-corporations
It's small, specialized, incentivized teams

Enterprises are learning this the hard way
