## Summary of the Article

The article reports the acquisition of the AI startup Windsurf by OpenAI, completed for a valuation of $3 billion. Windsurf, formerly known as Codeium, develops software that enables developers to write code using natural language. This aligns with the services provided by OpenAI's ChatGPT as well as competing products like GitHub's Copilot, Anthropic, and Anysphere's Cursor.

Post-acquisition, key personnel from Windsurf, including CEO Varun Mohan and co-founder Douglas Chen, along with some developers from the R&D department, are moving to Google's DeepMind. At Google, they will focus on developing the Gemini AI models, specifically aimed at "agentic coding" where AI handles programming tasks autonomously.

Google is involved with Windsurf through a separate agreement, paying $2.4 billion in license fees to use certain technologies from the startup on a non-exclusive basis. However, this agreement does not entail any acquisition of shares in Windsurf or impart any control rights to Google.

Jeff Wang, who has been part of Windsurf since mid-2023, will temporarily take over as CEO following the transition of Mohan to Google. The acquisition of Windsurf by OpenAI followed a phase of speculation and involved participation from venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins and General Catalyst.

Key figures involved are:
- **Windsurf (formerly Codeium)**: The AI startup acquired by OpenAI.
- **Varun Mohan**: CEO of Windsurf, moving to Google's DeepMind.
- **Douglas Chen**: Co-founder of Windsurf, joining DeepMind.
- **Jeff Wang**: Previously Head of Business, stepping in as CEO at Windsurf.

Competing entities and technologies mentioned include:
- **GitHub's Copilot**: A natural language code-writing tool.
- **Anthropic and Anysphere (Cursor)**: Competitors in the noise-based software space. 

This strategic shuffle indicates OpenAI's expansion in AI-driven coding technologies and Google DeepMind's focus on autonomous programming capabilities.
